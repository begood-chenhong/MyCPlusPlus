# MyCPlusPlus
This project aims at creating basic c++ classes and modules. More modules will be integrated into it step by step. 
It uses cmake to generate Makefile.
It uses google test to do basic unit test. 
Its directory structure obeys the basic project naming convention. Hopefully, bigger application can be built based on it.

Usage:
After git clone or download, below commands could be used to build the projects and run the testing:
$ cmake .
$ make

A lot of thanks to:
1) Google test authors and user group. 
I Also refer to the usage description at:
